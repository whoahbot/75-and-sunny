        <h4>75 degrees and sunny</h4>
<p>The inspiration for this hat started on a typical northwest day in the Gorge. Rain with surprisingly strong winds. Run, hike, repeat as I headed up Hamilton Mt. where clouds and fog forget definitions between waves of wind. Less than ahalf mile from the top, some other adventurous souls were making their way back down. As we passed on the trail, the last guy puts his hand on my shoulder and reassures me "don't worry, it's 75 degrees and sunny at the top" we both laughed and continued on our way</p>

<p>This joke has stayed with me for a while now, I hope this playful optimisim, despite circumstances surrounds you in your adventures to come.</p>

<p>wear this hat with many smiles</p>
